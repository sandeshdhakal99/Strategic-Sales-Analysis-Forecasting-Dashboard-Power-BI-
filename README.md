The goal of this project is to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights. Using Power BI, the analysis covers:
- Time‑series sales trends (monthly, quarterly, seasonal)
- Customer segmentation by age, gender, and region
- Product category and SKU‑level performance
- Regional and shipping mode dynamics
- Predictive “What‑If” simulations for pricing and quantity changes
- Forecasting future sales using Power BI’s ETS model
